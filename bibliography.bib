	abstract = {Graphs are an effective and compelling way to present scientific results.  With few rigid guidelines, researchers have many degrees-of-freedom regarding graph construction.  One such choice is the range of the y-axis.  A range set just beyond the data will bias readers to see all effects as big. Conversely, a range set to the full range of options will bias readers to see all effects as small.  Researchers should maximize congruence between visual size of an effect and the actual size of the effect.  In the experiments presented here, participants viewed graphs with the y-axis set to the minimum range required for all the data to be visible, the full range from 0 to 100, and a range of approximately 1.5 standard deviations.  The results showed that participants’ sensitivity to the effect depicted in the graph was better when the y-axis range was between one to two standard deviations than with either the minimum range or the full range.  In addition, bias was also smaller with the standardized axis range than the minimum or full axis ranges.  To achieve congruency in scientific fields for which effects are standardized, the y-axis range should be no less than 1 standard deviations, and aim to be at least 1.5 standard deviations.},

            Consumers’ judgments of the magnitude of benefit that a product provides increase their likelihood of purchasing it, and their judgments of the magnitude of harm that accrues from purchasing a product decrease their likelihood of purchasing it. When assessing the magnitude of a product’s potential outcome, consumers often encounter information about its probability of occurring. Ten studies demonstrate that this information biases consumers’ product decisions. Consumers both expect and perceive larger-probability outcomes to be larger in magnitude—even when they receive identical and objective information about the outcome’s actual magnitude. This bias emerges because people believe that larger probabilities emanate from more powerful causal antecedents, and in turn expect more powerful antecedents to produce larger outcomes. Moreover, this bias shapes consumers’ product decisions. Of course, it is rational for people to prefer products that promise high-probability benefits and to avoid products that produce high-probability harms. But consumers irrationally overweight this probability information because it distorts their judgments of the magnitude of products’ benefits and harms, and this distortion biases their purchase decisions.},

Accuracy and speed of processing were compared for six different presentation formats: pie charts, vertical bars, horizontal bars, numbers, systematic ovals, and random ovals. Quantities were used in two tasks: a choice task that required larger/smaller judgments and an estimate task that required more precise evaluation. The impacts of blue-yellow color and of a treatment-decision context on performance in the two tasks were also investigated. The study included four experiments. Taken together the results suggest that the formats best for making a choice differ from those best for estimating the size of an amount. For making a choice, vertical bars, horizontal bars, numbers, and systematic ovals were equally well perceived; pie charts and random ovals caused slower and less accurate performances. For estimating, numbers led to the most accurate estimates, followed by systematic ovals. The other four formats led to the least accurate estimates. Color and context did not alter which formats were best. Key words: decision making; quantitative information presentation; questionnaire format. (Med Decis Making 2000;20:228-238)},

	abstract = {Background. Visual aids tend to help diverse and vulnerable individuals understand risk communications, as long as these individuals have a basic understanding of graphs (i.e., graph literacy). Tests of objective graph literacy (OGL) can effectively identify individuals with limited skills, highlighting vulnerabilities and facilitating custom-tailored risk communication. However, the administration of these tests can be time-consuming and may evoke negative emotional reactions (e.g., anxiety). Objectives. To evaluate a brief and easy-to-use assessment of subjective graph literacy (SGL) (i.e., self-reported ability to process and use graphically presented information) and to estimate the robustness and validity of the SGL scale and compare it with the leading OGL scale in diverse samples from different cultures. Participants. Demographically diverse residents ( n = 470) of the United States, young adults ( n = 172) and patients (n = 175) from Spain, and surgeons ( n = 175) from 48 countries. Design. A focus group and 4 studies for instrument development and initial validation (study 1), reliability and convergent and discriminant validity evaluation (study 2), and predictive validity estimation (studies 3 and 4). Measures. Psychometric properties of the scale. Results. In about 1 minute, the SGL scale provides a reliable, robust, and valid assessment of skills and risk communication preferences and evokes fewer negative emotional reactions than the OGL scale. Conclusions. The SGL scale can be suitable for use in clinical research and may be useful as a communication aid in clinical practice. Theoretical mechanisms involved in SGL, emerging applications, limitations, and open questions are discussed.},
